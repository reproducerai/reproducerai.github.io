# 👋 Hi, I'm **[Minhaj](https://ansariminhaj.github.io)**  

I run **[reproducerai](https://reproducerai.github.io/ai-repro-blog/)** — a project where I explore AI models using **synthetic datasets**.  

---

### 🔬 What I Do
- 🧪 Test how different AI architectures, learning strategies, and datasets affect model performance.
- 🎯 Use synthetic datasets in a controlled environment to isolate and understand the impact of each change.
- 📝 Share findings on my blog:  **[reproducerai_web](https://reproducerai.github.io/ai-repro-blog/)**. 

---

### 🌱 My Goal
AI papers often adopt certain hyperparameters, architectural choices, or learning strategies without really explaining why they work. Right now, AI development is still mostly trial and error. I want to explore the fundamentals of AI, so we can make model design and training more deliberate, predictable, and less based on intuition or guesswork.
