### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to test how different AI architectures, learning strategies, and datasets affect model performance in an easy-to-understand way. By using synthetic datasets in a controlled environment, we can isolate and see the impact of each change. All findings are shared here.

### Goal
AI development is still trial and error. We adopt certain hyperparameters, architectural choices, or learning strategies without really knowing why they work. My goal is to explore the fundamentals of AI, so we can make model design and training more deliberate, predictable, and less based on intuition or guesswork.
