### 🔬 Purpose
- 🧪 Test how different AI architectures, learning strategies, and datasets affect model performance.
- 🎯 Use synthetic datasets in a controlled environment to isolate and understand the impact of each change.
- 📝 Share findings and insights here.

### 🌱 Goal
AI papers often adopt certain hyperparameters, architectural choices, or learning strategies without really explaining why they work. Right now, AI development is still mostly trial and error. I want to explore the fundamentals of AI, so we can make model design and training more deliberate, predictable, and less based on intuition or guesswork.
