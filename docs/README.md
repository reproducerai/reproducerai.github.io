### Purpose
- Test how different AI architectures, learning strategies, and datasets affect model performance in a easy-to-understand way.
- Use synthetic datasets in a controlled environment to isolate and understand the impact of each change.
- Share findings and insights here.

### Goal
AI papers adopt certain hyperparameters, architectural choices, or learning strategies without really explaining why they work. AI development is still trial and error. I want to explore the fundamentals of AI, so we can make model design and training more deliberate, predictable, and less based on intuition or guesswork.
